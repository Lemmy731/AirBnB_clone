#AirBnB Clone - The Console
Description
This project is part of the AirBnB clone series and focuses on building a command-line interpreter (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects. The CLI allows users to perform various operations on AirBnB objects, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects.

Command Interpreter
The command interpreter serves as the interface for interacting with AirBnB objects. It allows users to execute commands to perform different actions on objects.

How to Start
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the command interpreter script (console.py) using Python:
javascript
Copy code
python3 console.py
How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use the following commands to interact with AirBnB objects:

create: Create a new instance of an AirBnB object.
show: Display details of a specific AirBnB object.
destroy: Delete an existing AirBnB object.
all: Display all instances of a specific AirBnB object or all instances across all object types.
update: Update attributes of an existing AirBnB object.
Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:

Creating a new User object:

sql
Copy code
(hbnb) create User
Showing details of a specific Place object:

scss
Copy code
(hbnb) show Place 1234-5678
Deleting a City object:

scss
Copy code
(hbnb) destroy City 9876-5432
Displaying all instances of Review objects:
